[INDEV] mrklang, a programming language inspired by game hacking and utility

I have been having many concepts since I was 15 years old about creating my own programming language, I have attempted many trials before for the last 2 years, and I am finally serious about it. I have uploaded the project on github, so everyone would check it out :D The main idea of the language would be writing flawless c++/c/c#/java code at the same time, in one file, on all platforms. I am constantly working on it, although my time does not help because of school and online classes :( Hopefully it would be something to talk about one day in the future :) No one motivated me irl, so I thought about sharing it here
